Task ID: 0
Agent: orchestrator
Task: Project kickoff — build Ghana Digital Twin enterprise geospatial interface

Work Log:
- Explored existing Next.js 16 project: shadcn/ui (New York), Tailwind 4, framer-motion, recharts, zustand, react-resizable-panels, lucide all present
- Dev server confirmed running on port 3000
- Decided architecture: single `/` route, client-side SPA with Zustand view state, custom interactive SVG map of Ghana (no external tiles for reliability + digital-twin aesthetic), 6 views (Atlas, Observations, Entities, Graph, Sources, API)
- Design direction: dark "intelligence platform" theme, Ghana flag-inspired accents (emerald green + gold), teal for water, rose for alerts — NO indigo/blue

Stage Summary:
- No new packages needed; stack is sufficient
- Building design system, data layer, geo projection, store, then shell + 6 views

Task ID: 11
Agent: full-stack-developer
Task: Build SourcesView (data pipeline dashboard)

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md and prior context (Task 0 orchestrator kickoff; dark intelligence-platform theme, Ghana-flag accents emerald/gold + teal/rose/orange, NO indigo/blue).
- Read sources.ts (16 DATA_SOURCES: optical/sar/dem/landcover/weather/hydro/infrastructure/admin/environmental; INGESTION_LOG of 13 events with ok/warn/err status), format.ts (SOURCE_STATUS_META healthy/syncing/degraded/offline + helpers), store.ts (feed slice + pushFeed), atoms.tsx (MetricStat, StatusDot, SectionLabel, Sparkline, ConfidenceBar), types.ts (DataSource, SourceStatus, IngestionEvent).
- Confirmed shadcn/ui Card/Badge/Progress exist; globals.css defines .gdt-scroll and .tnum and @keyframes gdt-blink.
- Built /src/components/gdt/views/SourcesView.tsx as a flex-row full-height dashboard: LEFT (flex-1, gdt-scroll) header strip + 4 MetricStat KPIs + responsive 1/2/3-col Connectors grid; RIGHT (w-[340px], border-l, gdt-scroll) with Pipeline Health (status bar chart + sparkline), Ingestion Log (vertical timeline with left rail + colored dots + status icons), System Vitals (5 vital rows + live feed from store).
- ConnectorCard: status dot + name + provider, category/resolution badges, relative lastSync (inline relTime helper) + cadence, freshness Progress (log-scale fill, fresh=100) with CSS-var-driven indicator color, records + storage stats, coverage/license. Border tints with status color for degraded/offline. Clickable via pushFeed (manual sync queued event). hover:border-primary/40.
- Used inline helpers (relTime, fmtRecords, freshnessFill) — no extra date lib. Status icon mapping with animate-spin for syncing. All numbers use font-mono tnum. Semantic tokens only (bg-card/40, border-border, text-muted-foreground, text-foreground, bg-background) + accent hexes. No indigo/blue. No next/image. No `any`.
- Ran `bun run lint` — SourcesView.tsx produces ZERO errors. (One pre-existing error in LiveEngine.tsx about ref-during-render is unrelated to this task; dev.log missing-view errors are for sibling views owned by other agents.)

Stage Summary:
- SourcesView.tsx delivered: 1 named export, "use client", h-full w-full with internal gdt-scroll areas, TypeScript strict clean, no unused imports.
- High-density Palantir/Linear aesthetic: KPI strip, 16 connector cards with freshness bars + tinted borders, status bar chart, ingestion timeline, vitals + live feed.
- Fully wired to existing data (DATA_SOURCES, INGESTION_LOG, SOURCE_STATUS_META) and store (feed + pushFeed for card click → manual sync event).
- Lint status: PASS for SourcesView.tsx (0 errors, 0 warnings).

Task ID: 12
Agent: full-stack-developer
Task: Build ApiView (programmatic access primitives)

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md, types.ts, store.ts, atoms.tsx to understand GDT design system and conventions (dark tokens, emerald/gold/teal accents, SectionLabel/StatusDot atoms, gdt-scroll global class)
- Inspected existing data layer: ENTITIES (entities.ts), OBSERVATIONS (observations.ts), DATA_SOURCES (sources.ts), GRAPH_NODES/GRAPH_EDGES (graph.ts) — selected real sample records (ent-ankobra-river, obs-2841, src-s2) to drive authentic JSON response examples
- Verified Shell.tsx expects ApiView at ./views/ApiView and renders it inside motion.div className="absolute inset-0"
- Authored /home/z/my-project/src/components/gdt/views/ApiView.tsx — single "use client" file exporting named function ApiView()
- Defined typed ENDPOINTS array (19 endpoints across 7 groups: Spatial Queries, Temporal Queries, Observations, Entities, Knowledge Graph, Raster, Metadata). Each endpoint carries: id, group, method (GET/POST), path, label, description (mentions twin makes NO legal conclusions), params table, responseSchema field/type list, optional POST body, and a sample() closure returning real or realistic JSON
- LEFT column (lg:w-[300px], border-r, scrollable, p-3): endpoint navigator tree with sticky SectionLabel + count, search input filtering by path/label/group, grouped rows with method badge + mono path + label, selected row highlighted with bg-primary/10 border-l-2 border-primary
- RIGHT column (flex-1, scrollable, p-5): top-right Base URL pill (https://api.gdt.gh/v1) with copy button showing emerald check icon for 1.5s, endpoint header (method badge + path + ghost "Try it" button that copies curl), description paragraph, Parameters table (responsive shadcn-style with overflow-x-auto and min-w), Example Request <pre> with curl, Example Response <pre> with JSON.stringify of real sample data, Response Schema grid (font-mono muted), and a closing footer note about no legal conclusions
- MethodBadge component: GET=#34d399 emerald, POST=#fbbf24 gold, sized sm/lg with tokenized border/background
- CopyButton component: reusable, navigator.clipboard.writeText, 1.5s check feedback, accessible aria-label
- buildCurl helper: substitutes path args (:id, :z/:x/:y, :dataset, :date) and builds query string from required params; POST endpoints emit -d body
- Responsive layout: flex flex-col lg:flex-row, left column gets max-h-[38vh] on mobile so right column has room
- Used dark semantic tokens throughout: bg-background, bg-card/40, border-border, text-muted-foreground, bg-foreground/5, bg-foreground/[0.02] zebra rows
- Imports: useMemo, useState from react; SectionLabel from atoms; Button from ui; ENTITIES/OBSERVATIONS/DATA_SOURCES/GRAPH_NODES/GRAPH_EDGES from gdt lib; cn from utils; Check, Copy, Play, Search from lucide-react. No unused imports, no `any`

Stage Summary:
- File created: src/components/gdt/views/ApiView.tsx (~660 LOC)
- ESLint on the file: passes clean (0 errors, 0 warnings) — pre-existing error in LiveEngine.tsx is unrelated to this task
- Dev server compiles the new module without errors
- ApiView delivers a Palantir/Stripe-style API explorer: 19 typed endpoints, real-sample JSON responses (Ankobra River entity, OBS-2841 excavation observation, Sentinel-2 source, graph neighborhood), curl examples, parameter tables, response schemas, copyable base URL, "Try it" copy-curl action, and a closing reminder that the twin makes no legal conclusions

Task ID: 15
Agent: orchestrator
Task: End-to-end browser verification & finalization

Work Log:
- Fixed two import bugs: `formatCoord` was imported from `@/lib/gdt/format` in EntityDetail.tsx and StatusBar.tsx, but it lives in `@/lib/gdt/geo` — corrected both. Page now compiles (HTTP 200).
- Fixed LiveEngine.tsx lint error (ref-during-render) by removing unused view tracking.
- Ran `bun run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings (clean).
- Used Agent Browser (1440x900) to verify:
  * Atlas view: Ghana map recognizable, layers/legend/active-changes/timeline panels render, no layout problems (VLM-confirmed Palantir/Linear aesthetic).
  * Clicked map entity (Pra River Watershed) → inspector opened with version history + related observations. ✓
  * Navigated all 6 views via nav rail (mapped nav[0..5] → Atlas, Observations, Entities, Knowledge Graph, Data Sources, API). All render with content, no blanks/overlaps. ✓
  * Observations view: change-detection feed with stats, filters, list. ✓
  * Knowledge Graph view: node-link graph visible with circles + edges. ✓
  * Sources view: connector cards + stats visible. ✓
  * API view: endpoint list + code/response blocks visible. ✓
  * Opened an observation (OBS-2841) → inspector showed before/after satellite-imagery evidence pair, confidence 82%, reasoning, supporting evidence. ✓
  * Command palette (⌘K / search button): opens with Navigate/Temporal Mode/Observations/Entities/Regions sections. ✓
  * Temporal toggle Live↔Historical: "AS-OF" mode confirmed. ✓
  * Mobile (390x844): layout adapts, no horizontal overflow, status bar pinned at bottom. ✓
- No console errors, no hydration warnings, dev log clean (all 200s).

Stage Summary:
- Application is fully functional and browser-verified across all 6 views.
- Core golden path works: map interaction → inspector → entity/observation details → evidence → related navigation.
- Responsive (mobile + desktop), sticky status bar at bottom, no runtime errors.
- Project COMPLETE and production-quality.
